                        <p>Hello! I am a graphic designer that has always had a passion for art. Since I was a child I have worked on many art mediums, photography, and graphic design. I finally decided to make this my career when I attended Saskatchewan Polytechnic from 2020-2022. My skills as an artist have been sharpened, however I am always keen to learn new things at any opportunity I get. I also enjoy video games/tech and meeting new people!</p>

                    <p>For this project we were given an event with text that we were tasked to put into a poster and brochure design. Using Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign I put these two pieces together. I created shapes in Illustrator, created the backgrounds in Photoshop, and placed the text and images in InDesign. I also created the Food Banks logo used on the design.</p>
