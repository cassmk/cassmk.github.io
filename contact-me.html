                    <p>For this project we were given an event with text that we were tasked to put into a poster and brochure design. Using Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign I put these two pieces together. I created shapes in Illustrator, created the backgrounds in Photoshop, and placed the text and images in InDesign. I also created the Food Banks logo used on the design.</p>
